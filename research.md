# Research

I am broadly interested in **Biostatistics** and **Epidemiology**, with a particular focus on **cancer survivorship**, **cancer epidemiology**, and **health promotion**.

I am currently working with [Dr. Candemir Cigsar](#) and [Dr. Yildiz Yilmaz](#) on **quantile regression for bivariate sequential survival data**.

Before joining MUN, I gained research experience in **data visualization** with [Dr. Shenghui Cheng](#) and in **bioinformatics** with [Dr. Guangfu Jin](#). I also developed a strong interest in **missing data in survival analysis** while working with [Dr. Dylan Spicker](#) during my undergraduate studies.
