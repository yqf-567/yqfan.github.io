# Research


I am broadly interested in **Biostatistics** and **Epidemiology**, with a particular focus on **cancer survivorship**, **cancer epidemiology**, and **health promotion**.

I am currently working with [Dr. Candemir Cigsar](https://www.math.mun.ca/~ccigsar/) and [Dr. Yildiz Yilmaz](https://www.math.mun.ca/~yyilmaz/) on **quantile regression for bivariate sequential survival data**.

Before joining MUN, I gained research experience in **data visualization** with [Dr. Shenghui Cheng](https://www.csh.ac.cn/) and in **bioinformatics** with [Dr. Guangfu Jin](https://www.sciconf.cn/cn/person-detail/397?user_id=9PSKgeEWvTJVnbx50_jaByA_d_d). I also developed a strong interest in **missing data in survival analysis** while working with [Dr. Dylan Spicker](https://dylanspicker.com/) during my undergraduate studies.
